We shall build an online voting platform backed by Azure Blockchain.  
This platform will make the process of voting easy. The votes casted will be tamper-proof i.e. immutable which is one of the key aspects of blockchain. This will also ensure that people from remote locations can securely vote online. Also, this platform will ensure that a first time voter is registered and hence casts his/her vote. This platform will also maintain other details of a voter as well as candidates such as criminal records, funds, assets, etc. Since the ledger of a blockchain is immutable, one can resolve any accusation of EVM tampering, which has been in news lately.
